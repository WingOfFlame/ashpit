-edited esf14.js/css/main
-our widget can switch back and forth between 3 templates/views
-main view would be view 1
-course detail would be view 2
-event detail would be view 3
-Justin will layout main view and transition from view 1 to view 2
-Xin will work on view 2 to view 3
-leave color view to the last

-IF YOU HAVE BETTER IMPLEMENTATION, DO IT AND UPDATE

-change the name of View3 to addeventView
-chagne the name of View2 to eventlistView
-added stuff for view3 in esf14.js and templates.txt
	- the basic html
	- the javascript needed to add an event
-I did not use dropdown for priority, I feel like radio button would be better, should we change our proposal?

* THIS IS NOT A MAJOR CHANGE AND I DONT THINK WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR PROPOSAL. THE FUNCTIONALITY IS SAME
-changed view1 to MainView
-trying to add course info list and student bio info. 
-added content to template.txt to reflect the above changes
-adding 2 fields: current_term and exams to model
-next step: filter course info list to have courses of current term only, retrive exam schedule of these courses, combine these info to create a list view

-onclick function get lost if we replace html. so each time we change view we call init() to restore onclick function, and updateview to restore data from saved variable.
-got list view work
-added onclick function to each listed course
-rendered visual of buttons and list with bootstrap

The thing runs locally now, if you want to turn of local mode, go to the model init, and set var local = false
But! there is a bug, which is like the list doesnt show up immediately, but click next and then go back, you will see it

One more thing, the link from course to arrayview should work now (click function was modified)
