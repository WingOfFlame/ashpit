CS349 ASSIGNMENT 3 MARKING SCHEME
MARKED BY: y57luo (@uwaterloo.ca)

GUIDELINES
The assignment needs to compile and run in order for the TA to mark it. 
If it doesn't compile, but the TA is able to get it working, you will 
only lose marks for the "Compiles and runs" section. 
If they cannot get it to compile, you receive zero for the assignment.

Remark requests will be considered for 2 weeks following the release of 
the marks for this assignment. 
To request a remark, contact the TA that marked your assignment (identified 
above) during office hours or through email.
